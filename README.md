# GitHub API app 
## (Architecture of Software Systems project)
The idea of this application is to make it easier for useres to search for repositories or GitHub users.
The app provides a simple UI which connects directly to GitHub API using Retrofit2 library.
The app also contains a local database which allows users to save their favourite repositories and check it in offline mode.

## Used libraries:
Retrofit2 , Realm database , RecyclerView ,and CardView.

## Used design patterns:
Singleton , Adapter , facade ,and Strategy.

## Notes:

We attach the full steps and documentation of each patterns as comments in the project.

The using of Adapter design pattern is a little bit different in android, but it serves the same purpose, we alose mentioned that in the comments.
